The sampled signal from 5 sensors is saved in the file 5sensordata.xlsm.
 I have encoded the data using huffmann coding and stored in the file encoded.txt.
Later the file is read and decoded to compare if there was any error in codind and decoding.

Run the matlab file huffman.m from program execution.
